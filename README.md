<h1>Mouse Tracker with Data Saving</h1>

<h2>code role</h2>

This JavaScript code is designed to track the mouse position of a user on a webpage and save the data to a JSON file upon exit of the page. The data is saved in a format that ranks the most frequented positions on the page. The code includes error handling and security measures to ensure robustness and security.

***Tracking Mouse Position:***

*The code tracks the position of the user's mouse on a webpage by dividing the page into cubic sections. The number of cubes is determined by the surface area of the page and changes as the page size is altered. The size of each cube is also determined by the page size. The code continuously monitors the position of the user's mouse and records the cube that it occupies.*

***Saving Data to JSON File:***

*The data is saved to a JSON file upon exit of the page. The code creates an object to store the data, including the size of the page and the size of each cube. The cube position data is saved as an array of objects, each object containing the cube's coordinates and the duration that the mouse was present in the cube.*

***Ranking Most Frequented Positions:***

*The data saved in the JSON file is organized to rank the most frequented positions on the page. The code sorts the array of cube position objects by duration and returns the top five positions.*


***Error Handling and Security Measures:***

*To ensure the robustness and security of the code, error handling and security measures are implemented. The code includes data validation and sanitization to prevent malicious input. The JSON file is stored securely to prevent unauthorized access. Additionally, the code includes error handling for potential runtime errors*
